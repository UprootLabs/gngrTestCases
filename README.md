# gngr test cases

These are tests created during development of [gngr](https://gngr.info).

# hosting

The branch `gh-pages` is used for hosting the test-cases on Github.io.

The test-cases are in the `test-case/` folder. Unfortunately, they are not listed automatically.
Hence, you need to enter the direct-url for a specific test-case. For example, the test for [issue 36](https://github.com/UprootLabs/gngr/issues/36) can be accessed with [this url](http://uprootalbs.github.io/gngrTestCases/test-case/i36/).
